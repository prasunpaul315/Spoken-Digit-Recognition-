# Spoken-Digit-Recognition


In this notebook, You will do Spoken Digit Recognition. 

Input - speech signal, output - digit number



It contains  

1. Reading the dataset. and Preprocess the data set. Detailed instrctions are given below. You have to write the code in the same cell which contains the instrction. 
2. Training the LSTM with RAW data
3. Converting to spectrogram and Training the LSTM network
4. Creating the augmented data and doing step 2 and 3 again.  

<font size=5>Instructions:</font>

    1. Don't change any Grader Functions. Don't manipulate any Grader functions. If you manipulate any, it will be considered as plagiarised. 
    
    2. Please read the instructions on the code cells and markdown cells. We will explain what to write. 
    
    3. Please return outputs in the same format what we asked. Eg. Don't return List of we are asking for a numpy array.
    
    4. Please read the external links that we are given so that you will learn the concept behind the code that you are writing.
    
    5. We are giving instructions at each section if necessary, please follow them. 

<font size=5>Every Grader function has to return True. </font>
